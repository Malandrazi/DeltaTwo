a Simple Windows System monitor written in VB script that creates Spoken computer responses when silent changes are made in the background of the Windows OS.
Example- when a firewall rule is added or deleted the computer will tell you with a spoken warning.

The xml files are Designed to be imported with Task Scheduler in Windows.
You may need to change the Save Path for the VBS files on the  actions tab in task sceduler to use these.
D:\VBS\Scripts\WindowsScripts

I will be including a Windows installer as soon as I code it.
